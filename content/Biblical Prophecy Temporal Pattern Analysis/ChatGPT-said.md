Short answer: I scanned **Grock.md**. The actual datasets are **not** present as clean, loadable files.

What I found:

- **Prophecy CSV:** only a placeholder - "Content of `prophecies_for_analysis_cleaned.csv` will be inserted here" (no data block included) .
    
- **Quantum milestones:** there's a long JSON-looking list embedded in the text (with `year`, `event`, `severity_score`), but it's **not valid JSON** as written (contains Markdown links, truncations/duplicates). Examples here: . It also appears repeated/truncated later (e.g., ending mid-entry) .
    
- **Grace time series (`t,G,P,F`)**: not present anywhere.
    

I tried auto-extracting and sanitizing the JSON from the Markdown (removed Markdown links, fixed commas, etc.), but it still doesn't parse cleanly, likely due to truncation. So at the moment I can't feed Grock.md directly into the replication pipeline.

Want me to proceed one of these ways?

1. **Best-effort salvage now:** I can write a tolerant parser to reconstruct the quantum list from the text (dropping damaged rows, normalizing `severity_score→severity`) and save it as `/mnt/data/quantum_milestones.json`. That will let us at least run the quantum-acceleration side of the audit.
    
2. **Clean upload (preferred):**
    
    - Upload `prophecies_for_analysis_cleaned.csv` with columns like: `id, book, prophecy_text, revelation_year, status, category`.
        
    - Upload `quantum_milestones.json` as valid JSON (fields: `year, domain, event, severity`), or the CSV equivalent.
        
    - (Optional) Upload `grace_timeseries.csv` with columns `t,G,P,F`.
        

If you choose (1), I'll salvage what's there and document any rows I had to drop. If you choose (2), as soon as you upload those files, I'll rerun the full **Path C** replication end-to-end.
