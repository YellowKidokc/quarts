# Claude Laws - Quantum-Theological Framework Tools

A suite of non-destructive Python tools for analyzing and organizing your Quantum-Theological Framework in Obsidian.

## Overview

These tools help you analyze, organize, and visualize the connections between your 10 Universal Laws without modifying your original content. All outputs are stored in a dedicated "Claude Laws" folder.

## Features

- **Law Indexing**: Create searchable indexes of all your law content
- **Concept Analysis**: Analyze theological and physics concepts across your framework
- **Connection Mapping**: Visualize connections between different laws
- **Master Document Generation**: Combine all laws into comprehensive documents
- **Obsidian Integration**: Run directly from within Obsidian using Shell Commands

## Installation

1. Download all files to a temporary location
2. Run `install.py` from within your Obsidian vault:
    
    ```bash
    python install.py
    ```
    
3. The installer will:
    - Create a "Claude Laws" folder in your vault
    - Set up the necessary folder structure
    - Copy all script files to the right locations
    - Create configuration files
    - Check for required Python packages

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Obsidian
- The following Python packages:
    - matplotlib
    - networkx
    - nltk

## Obsidian Integration

These tools can be run directly from within Obsidian using the "Shell commands" community plugin:

1. Install the "Shell commands" community plugin in Obsidian
2. Go to Settings > Shell Commands
3. Add commands following the guide in `Claude Laws/Scripts/obsidian_commands.md`

## Available Tools

### index_laws.py

Creates an index of all content in your 10 Laws folders.

- Lists all files, their paths, and metadata
- Generates both JSON and markdown outputs
- Useful for navigating and finding content

### analyze_concepts.py

Analyzes theological and physics concepts across your framework.

- Identifies key theological concepts (trinity, sin, grace, etc.)
- Maps physics concepts (quantum mechanics, relativity, etc.)
- Finds connections between theological and physics concepts
- Generates visualizations of concept relationships

### generate_master.py

Creates master documents combining all laws.

- Generates a comprehensive document with all laws
- Creates an executive summary of the framework
- Maintains proper structure with table of contents
- Removes frontmatter for clean presentation

### find_connections.py

Maps connections between different laws in your framework.

- Identifies explicit links between laws
- Detects implicit mentions of other laws
- Visualizes the connection network
- Generates detailed reports of connections

## Folder Structure

After installation, you'll have the following structure:

```
Claude Laws/
├── Scripts/                     # Python scripts
│   ├── index_laws.py
│   ├── analyze_concepts.py
│   ├── generate_master.py
│   ├── find_connections.py
│   ├── config.json
│   └── obsidian_commands.md     # Obsidian setup guide
├── Outputs/                     # All outputs stored here
│   ├── Analyses/                # Concept analysis reports
│   ├── Indexes/                 # Law indexes
│   ├── Visualizations/          # Charts and visualizations
│   └── Master Documents/        # Combined law documents
└── README.md                    # Documentation
```

## Safety

All tools are designed to be non-destructive:

- They only read from your existing vault
- They never modify your original content
- All outputs are stored in the Claude Laws folder
- You can delete the Claude Laws folder at any time without affecting your vault

## Mem0 Integration (Optional)

The tools include optional integration with mem0ai for advanced memory and search capabilities:

1. Install the mem0ai package:
    
    ```bash
    pip install mem0ai
    ```
    
2. Set your API key in the config.json file:
    
    ```json
    {
        "mem0_enabled": true,
        "mem0_api_key": "your-api-key"
    }
    ```
    
3. Run the tools as normal - they'll automatically detect and use mem0ai when enabled
    

## Troubleshooting

**Missing Packages** If you see errors about missing packages, install them manually:

```bash
pip install matplotlib networkx nltk
```

**Permission Errors** If you get permission errors running scripts in Obsidian:

1. Make sure Python is in your system PATH
2. Try running the scripts from a terminal first
3. Check that the Shell Commands plugin has necessary permissions

**Visualization Errors** If visualizations don't generate:

1. Install matplotlib: `pip install matplotlib`
2. Install networkx: `pip install networkx`
3. Try running the script from a terminal to see detailed error messages
