### 2) Lightweight Variant (when you need speed)

`--- title: "" created: {{date:YYYY-MM-DD}} status: draft type: note domains: [] topics: [] tags: [] people: [] places: [] sources: {primary: [], secondary: [], scripture: [], links: []} summary: "" key_points: [] actions: [] ---`

---

### 3) Example Filled-In (your Archaeology list note)

`--- title: "Archaeological & Historical Places - Linked Map Index" created: {{date:YYYY-MM-DD}} updated: {{date:YYYY-MM-DD}} author: "David Lowe" status: final security: normal sensitivity: low  type: research mode: integrated  domains:   - christian-studies   - archaeology topics:   - Second Temple   - Gospels   - Pilgrimage sites tags: [#archeology, #israel, #timeline, #maps]  places: [Galilee, Samaria, Jerusalem, Lebanon, Jordan] geo: {region: "IL-PS-LB-JO"} timeframe: {event_date: ""}  sources:   primary: []   secondary:     - "Josephus, *Antiquities* / *War* (Royal Stoa descriptions)"   scripture:     - "Luke 2; John 5; John 11; Mark 14-16; Acts 1"   links: []   # keep external URLs inside body as [Name](URL)  summary: "Curated, grouped list of Gospel-related sites with clean, clickable map links for Obsidian." key_points:   - Grouped by region to prevent scattering   - Obsidian-friendly hidden URLs   - Ready for Dataview queries actions: [] review: {next_review: , priority: 2} license: "CC BY-NC 4.0" ---`

---

### 4) Dataview Helpers (optional)

**By domain**

`TABLE status, type, topics, places FROM "" WHERE contains(domains, "archaeology") SORT created DESC`

**Review queue**

`TASK FROM "" WHERE !completed AND review.next_review SORT review.next_review ASC`

**Map candidates (notes that have geo)**

`LIST rows.file.link WHERE geo.lat AND geo.lon`

---

### 5) Templater snippet (auto-date & skeleton)

If you use the **Templater** plugin, put this in a template file:

`--- title: "<% tp.file.title %>" created: <% tp.date.now("YYYY-MM-DD") %> updated: <% tp.date.now("YYYY-MM-DD") %> author: "David Lowe" status: draft security: normal sensitivity: low type: note mode: strategic domains: [] topics: [] tags: [] people: [] places: [] geo: {lat: , lon: , region: ""} timeframe: {start: , end: , event_date: } sources: {primary: [], secondary: [], scripture: [], links: []} summary: "" key_points: [] actions: [] relations: {relates_to: [], supersedes: [], superseded_by: []} review: {next_review: , priority: 3} license: "CC BY-NC 4.0" ---`
