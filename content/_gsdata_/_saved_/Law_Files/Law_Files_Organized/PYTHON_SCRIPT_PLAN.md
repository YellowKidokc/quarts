# Law Files Organization Analysis & Python Script Plan

## Pattern Analysis from Current Files:

### Naming Patterns Detected:
1. **Law Number Patterns:**
   - "Law 1", "Law 2", "LAW 3", "Law 4", etc.
   - "Law_01", "Law_02", etc.
   - Mixed case inconsistencies

2. **Content Type Patterns:**
   - "Main Document" = MD (Main Document)
   - "Introduction" = IN
   - "Comprehensive Concept Map" = CM
   - "Story" = ST
   - "Meta" = MT
   - "Final for Substack" = Publication ready
   - "Executive Summary" = ES
   - Numbered duplicates (1), (2), (3), etc.

3. **Topic Patterns:**
   - Law 1: Gravity, Sin
   - Law 2: Nuclear, Unity, Entanglement
   - Law 3: Electromagnetism, Light, Truth
   - Law 4: Weak Force
   - Law 5: Thermodynamics, Energy
   - Law 6: Cause & Effect, Sowing & Reaping
   - Law 7: Quantum, Uncertainty, Relativity
   - Law 8: Phase Transitions
   - Law 9: Forces, Authority
   - Law 10: Unified, Consciousness

## Python Script Strategy:

### Phase 1: Analysis & Cataloging
- Scan all files and extract law numbers, content types
- Identify duplicates and versions
- Create mapping of files to categories

### Phase 2: Smart Renaming
- Apply LW-##-TYPE-DESCRIPTOR naming convention
- Handle duplicates by moving to review folder
- Preserve best versions in main categories

### Phase 3: Organization
- Move files to appropriate target folders
- Generate gap analysis report
- Create publication readiness assessment

## Script Features Needed:
1. **File Scanner** - Regex patterns to identify law numbers and types
2. **Duplicate Detector** - Find numbered versions and similar content
3. **Smart Categorizer** - Map content to target structure
4. **Batch Renamer** - Apply LW naming convention
5. **Gap Analyzer** - Identify missing content types per law
6. **Quality Assessor** - Identify publication-ready vs draft versions

Would you like me to write this Python script? It could process all 400+ files in seconds rather than hours of manual work.
