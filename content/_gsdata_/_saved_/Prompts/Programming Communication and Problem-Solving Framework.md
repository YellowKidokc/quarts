# Programming Communication and Problem-Solving Framework

## Intent Communication Commands

### /GOAL

_Communication Prompt:_ "What are we trying to achieve at the highest level?"

Copy

`/GOAL - Primary objective: Build inventory management system - End users: Warehouse staff - Key requirements: Real-time updates, barcode scanning - Success metrics: 99.9% accuracy, <500ms response time`

### /CONTEXT

_Communication Prompt:_ "What's the existing environment and constraints?"

Copy

`/CONTEXT - Current stack: Python/Django backend - Database: PostgreSQL - Infrastructure: AWS - Performance requirements: 1000 concurrent users - Security requirements: SOC2 compliance`

### /CLARIFY

_Communication Prompt:_ "Let's confirm understanding before coding."

Copy

`/CLARIFY inventory_system - Is this correct? System will:   1. Track real-time inventory levels  2. Support barcode scanning via mobile app  3. Generate alerts at low stock levels  4. Maintain audit trail - Questions:   1. Should prices be included?  2. What's the expected item count?`

## Problem-Solving Commands

### /APPROACH

_Solution Prompt:_ "Let's design the solution architecture."

Copy

`/APPROACH inventory_tracking 1. Data Model:    - Items (id, name, sku, quantity)   - Movements (item_id, quantity_delta, timestamp) 2. API Design:    - REST endpoints for CRUD   - WebSocket for real-time updates 3. Technology Choices:    - Django REST framework   - Redis for caching   - Celery for async tasks`

### /PATTERN

_Solution Prompt:_ "What design patterns fit this problem?"

Copy

`/PATTERN - Observer: For inventory level notifications - Command: For tracking all modifications - Repository: For data access abstraction - Strategy: For different pricing models`

### /RISKS

_Solution Prompt:_ "What could go wrong? Let's address it upfront."

Copy

`/RISKS 1. Race Conditions:    - Solution: Optimistic locking 2. Data Consistency:    - Solution: Transaction boundaries 3. Performance:    - Solution: Caching strategy 4. Security:    - Solution: Input validation, rate limiting`

## Implementation Commands

### /SCAFFOLD

_Code Prompt:_ "Generate initial project structure."

Copy

`/SCAFFOLD django_inventory - Create project skeleton - Set up basic models - Configure authentication - Add testing framework - Initialize documentation`

### /MODULE

_Code Prompt:_ "Generate specific module with tests."

Copy

`/MODULE inventory_tracker - Core functionality - Unit tests - Integration tests - Documentation - Usage examples`

### /OPTIMIZE

_Code Prompt:_ "Enhance performance and reliability."

Copy

`/OPTIMIZE 1. Database:    - Add indexes   - Optimize queries 2. Caching:    - Add Redis caching   - Configure cache invalidation 3. Async:    - Move heavy tasks to background`

## Testing Commands

### /TEST

_Testing Prompt:_ "Comprehensive test coverage."

Copy

`/TEST inventory_module 1. Unit Tests:    - CRUD operations   - Business logic 2. Integration Tests:    - API endpoints   - Database transactions 3. Load Tests:    - Concurrent users   - Data volume`

### /EDGE

_Testing Prompt:_ "Identify and test edge cases."

Copy

`/EDGE 1. Data Boundaries:    - Maximum quantities   - Unicode product names 2. Timing Issues:    - Concurrent updates   - System downtime 3. Error Conditions:    - Network failures   - Database deadlocks`

## Documentation Commands

### /DOC

_Documentation Prompt:_ "Generate comprehensive documentation."

Copy

`/DOC inventory_api 1. API Reference:    - Endpoints   - Parameters   - Response formats 2. Integration Guide:    - Authentication   - Rate limits   - Best practices 3. Examples:    - Common use cases   - Code samples`

## Knowledge Management Commands

### /LOG

_Learning Prompt:_ "Record what we learned."

Copy

`/LOG transaction_issue Problem: - Deadlock during high-volume updates Solution: - Implemented optimistic locking - Added retry mechanism Lessons: - Always consider concurrent access - Test with realistic data volumes`

### /REVIEW

_Learning Prompt:_ "Analyze what worked and what didn't."

Copy

`/REVIEW sprint_7 Successes: - Caching reduced load by 70% - New API design simplified integration Challenges: - Race conditions in batch updates - Performance with large datasets Solutions: - Implemented queue system - Added database partitioning`

## Integration Patterns

### Common Problem-Solving Pipeline:

Copy

`/GOAL + /CONTEXT + /CLARIFY + /APPROACH + /RISKS "Define problem completely before starting implementation."`

### Implementation Pipeline:

Copy

`/SCAFFOLD + /MODULE + /TEST + /OPTIMIZE "Build, test, and optimize in structured sequence."`

### Learning Pipeline:

Copy

`/LOG + /REVIEW + /DOC "Capture knowledge and improve future iterations."`

## Usage Best Practices

1. Always start with /GOAL and /CONTEXT
2. Use /CLARIFY before any major implementation
3. Maintain /LOG entries for significant problems/solutions
4. Run complete /TEST suite before optimization
5. Update /DOC with each significant change

## Feedback Loop

6. Record challenges and solutions
7. Review patterns in issues
8. Update approach based on lessons learned
9. Maintain knowledge base for future reference

This framework promotes:

- Clear communication
- Structured problem-solving
- Knowledge retention
- Continuous improvement
- Reusable patterns
