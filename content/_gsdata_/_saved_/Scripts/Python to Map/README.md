# Physics-Faith Concept Mapper

This is a backup copy of the Physics-Faith Concept Mapper project. This tool analyzes markdown files in the Law folders to identify concepts and connections between physics and faith concepts.

## Files Included

- `Physics-Faith Concept Mapper.py` - The main Python script
- `concept_categories.py` - Contains definitions of concept categories
- `related_terms.py` - Contains definitions of related terms
- `bidirectional_connections.py` - Contains bidirectional connections between physics and faith concepts
- `utils.py` - Contains utility functions
- `run_concept_mapper.bat` - Original batch file (may not work with UNC paths)
- `run_concept_mapper_local.bat` - Modified batch file that works with local paths
- `Law 1-4 folders` - Contains markdown files with concept maps

## How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed on your system
2. Run the script using the batch file:
   ```
   run_concept_mapper_local.bat
   ```

This will process all markdown files in the Law folders and generate concept maps in the Academy folder.

## Output

The script generates the following files in the Academy folder:

- Concept Inventory.md - A comprehensive inventory of concepts used across the Laws
- Cross-Law Connections.md - Maps connections between Laws based on shared concepts
- Concept Network Visualization.md - Visualizations of the concept network
- concept_data.json - JSON export of the concept data for further analysis
- Keyword Matrix.md - A matrix of keywords and their relationships
- Connection Ideas.md - Specific connection ideas for research

## Customization

You can customize the script by modifying:

- `concept_categories.py` - Add or modify concept categories
- `related_terms.py` - Add or modify related terms
- `bidirectional_connections.py` - Add or modify bidirectional connections

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Make sure Python is installed and in your PATH
2. Check that all required files are in the same directory
3. Ensure the Law folders contain markdown files
